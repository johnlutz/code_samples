The requirement from the client was for them to manage codes for a contest they were running and allow users to enter these codes into a form on the site's front end and validate the codes before allowing them to submit the form to enter the contest.  I built a configuration screen that simply shows a textarea for entering the codes.  The client also wanted a report of which codes were used most, so we show these aggregated results on the same screen as the code management textarea (all in one place).  On the front end, this implementation requires a webform as we create an extension of the normal WebformMultiple element so we can alter the multiple codes field the way the client wanted in the mockups.  The user can only enter up to 10 codes and they are shown one at a time and are validated as they are entered.  This is kind of hard coded in the fact that the management form and alter is built for summer2018, but the code validation code is generic enough that they could easily create a new campaign just by copying the config form and adding another line or 2.
