This is a d8 module that uses an external js library imager.js to allow cropping and resizing of images when the user uploads to an image field.  It adjusts the original image the user uploads and replaces it.  This was a requirement of the client because a lot of times users would upload images that were not rotated sideways and not cropped well and the editor had to manually crop and rotate images for his users.  This tool puts that control in the users' hands when they upload or afterwards when editing the media item.  It also makes it easier on the editor as they don't have to download the image, open in an editor, save, and reupload.  You can use it simply by turning it on and using the Imager Widget field widget for the image field in the form view.
